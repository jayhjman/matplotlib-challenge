1. Clone the [`git repository`](https://github.com/jayhjman/matplotlib-challenge) for this project
1. Change into the [`repository directory`](https://github.com/jayhjman/matplotlib-challenge) the [`pymaceuticals.ipynb`](pymaceuticals.ipynb) will be in the top level directory, no need to change to any sub-directory
1. Execute `jupyter notebook` via command line
1. Jupyer Notbook will open and once it does, select the file [`pymaceuticals.ipynb`](pymaceuticals.ipynb)
1. This will execute against the `csv` files found in [Mouse MetaData](data/Mouse_metadata.csv) and [Study Results Data](data/Study_results.csv) under `data` directory
1. Please execute `Kernal > Restart & Run All` from the Jupyter Notebook menu to see the results
